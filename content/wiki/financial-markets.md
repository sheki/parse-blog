The economist claims that the steam has gone out of globalization. A bigger segment
of the economy is now service based and difficult to trade. US is turning inwards under trump.
Globalization increased trade in a few particular regions for e.g. China-US. Now that the
steam has run out of US China trade, globalization's benefits are tapering off. The world
economy may not grow as the same rate as before.

## Airline Industry

Herb Kelleher's SouthWest airline is a unique airline.
They have been always profitable and believe in slow deliberate growth. Unlike other
airlines they fly point to point instead of using hubs. When they launch a city they
usually set up 6-7 flights. Efficiency and low turn around times are their modus operandi.
They were the original low cost airline. The only thing the rest of the airline
industry shared with SouthWest that it is run by big personalities. The airline
industry is competitive and chummy with the government. Deregulation in the 80s
made the prices drop but at the cost of a lot of well paying union jobs.

As of now, American, Delta and United are the worlds three biggest airlines.
The Chinese Airlines are growing at an unprecedented rate and are expected to
introduce lower fares and are better placed to serve new destinations in China.
