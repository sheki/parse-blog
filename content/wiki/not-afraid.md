*What would you do if you weren't afraid* was a poster stuck all over
FB. I have used it as a decision making tool. This is a record of the
times it has not worked well.

* Jan 31, 2019 - I was talking to a company for a consultation role. I did not
know what to charge them. I decided to charge them a high amount using the above
not afraid value. I did not get the deal. The company's reply was "Whoa - no way".
