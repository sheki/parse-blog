[The plastic backlash?](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/nov/13/the-plastic-backlash-whats-behind-our-sudden-rage-and-will-it-make-a-difference)

Plastics are a menace - they do not recycle well and create islands of trash in
the Oceans.  Plastics were pushed to consumers by oil companies as it is a bi-product
of oil refining. They lobbied the government to open recycling plants for plastic
even though plastic does not recycle well. The bigger problem is microbeads
that are present in everything like tires and shampoos.
Plastic has become enemy number 1 recently surpassing climate change. This is
because it is a cause the right and left can get behind together. Perhaps to
get rid of of the plastic scourge, we need to change our consumer culture.
