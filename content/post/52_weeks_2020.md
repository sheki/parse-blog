I am participating in [Reddits' 52 week cooking challenge](https://www.reddit.com/r/52weeksofcooking/comments/e9oxx0/2020_weekly_challenge_list/)
 this year. Here are the dishes I made.

Each week the mods declare an ingredient, technique, cuisine, or inspiration. My challenge is to cook a dish in that theme.

## Week 1: Miso

I made Chicken glazed with Miso or Lost in Translation chicken The recipe was from the cookbook [From the Oven to the Table](https://www.amazon.com/Oven-Table-Diana-Henry/dp/1784726095).
The previous week, I ran into a Japanese grocery store called Midoriya  near Union Square in NYC. So it was very easy to grab some red Miso from there.

## Week 2: Russian

I wanted to make Blinis, but I did not have enough time. So I made some Borscht. Borscht is generous dish, there is a lot of room to improvise.
I almost put curry powder in it, but didn't. I am going to have the Broscht at Veselka the Ukaranian restaurant in the East village to compare mine.
