Gandhi gave masses a Talisman. Growing up in India, I  found it printed on
every text book.

It goes as:

>*I will give you a talisman. Whenever you are in doubt, or when the self becomes
>too much with you, apply the following test. Recall the face of the poorest
>and the weakest man [woman] whom you may have seen, and ask yourself,
>if the step you contemplate is going to be of any use to him [her].
>Will he [she] gain anything by it? ...
>Then you will find your doubts and your self melt away.*

If I had to modify this for a software engineer - it would look like.

>*I will give you a talisman. Whenever you are in doubt - apply the following test.
Recall the face of the greenest - the least experienced developer with respect to the
given domain and problem.
