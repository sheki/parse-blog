We went to Portland ( me, Belle, Vlad and Srik). It was Vlad's good bye trip. He is moving to New York at the end of this week. This is partly sad and partly exciting.

I feel I expected a lot more from Portland the city due to pop culture references. It had good restaurants and bars - very good for a mid sized US city, but nothing made me feel like I can live here. The continuous gloomy rain did not help.

I finished reading Martin Amis' [Zone of Interest](http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/22/the-zone-of-interest-martin-amis-review-holocaust). It was a good dark fiction book set in Auschwitz. The book was very well researched.

At work I launched the [customer portal for bright](https://cuenta.thinkbright.mx). This is going to be huge.

I had dinner at [Foriegn Cinema](http://www.foreigncinema.com/) for the first time. They have a very good bavette steak.
