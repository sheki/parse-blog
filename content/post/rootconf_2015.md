I attended [RootConf 2015](https://rootconf.talkfunnel.com/2015/schedule)
in Bangalore. A big shout out to
[HasGeek](https://hasgeek.com/) for putting together a good conference.
I gave a talk on [Rewriting Parse.com](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXAwSHYdOqc) there.


I got a nice Introduction to SaltStack by [Mike Place](https://twitter.com/cachedout). Salt Stack looks like a cleaner better Chef/Puppet. A few Engineers I trust love it.
[Anand Chitipothu](https://twitter.com/anandology) presented a biased comparison of how Postgres is better than MySQL. He mostly compared MySQL 5.5 with MyISAM.
MySQL 5.6+ with InnoDB (the default option now) addresses majority of the
issues pointed out in the talk. I loved the [HTTP2 Primer](https://www.slideshare.net/extremeunix/quick-primer-on-http2) by [Cyrus Dasadia](https://twitter.com/extremeunix). It was simple introduction to the new standard.

I hosted a Database BoF with [Anand](https://twitter.com/anandology). The discussion quickly
split off into MySQL and the rest. A gentleman spoke about interesting problem of arranging data on to
various storage layers according to access patterns in
[SAP HANA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAP_HANA). Some one gave a good introduction to AerospikeDB. The MySQL
group was mostly discussed HA strategies. MySQL looked like the main database of
choice of people in the Bangalore tech scene. I did not find any serious deployments
of non MySQL databases there. This was my first time hand holding a session,
I liked it and for a moment considered a career as a Tech-Host.


Few women attended the conference. I guess "Women in Tech" is not an issue the
Bangalore scene is talking about yet.

I met a few cool startups, a few users of [Parse.com](https://parse.com) and a
few old friends. I was happy to be part of RootConf.
