[Ravan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravan), the king of Lanka and the
main antagonist of [Ramayana](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramayana)
was an ardent devotee of [Shiva](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiva).
Sometime before the main events of Ramayana unfolded, Ravan prayed to Shiva
and got hold of a powerful relic - *Atma Lingam*. On a side note, Demons
praying to gods and getting powerful relics / boons is a recurring theme in
Hindu mythology. Lord Shiva does place a condition, that Ravan has to carry the
Atma Lingam, without placing it down on the ground, until he reaches home - Lanka.

The rest of the Gods are worried that Ravan would become immensely powerful and hard
to defeat. The Gods come up with a plan to ensure that Ravan places the
AtmaLingam on the ground before reaching Lanka. This scheme is to be carried by
Shiva's son - [Ganesh](htps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganesh).

As Ravan is passing by [Gokarna](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gokarna), in
modern day Karnataka, India - the gods hide the sun. Ravan thinks that the sun
has set, it is his ritual to pray at dusk. Precisely at that point he is
approached by Ganesh, in the disguise of a priest. Ravan asks the priest to hold
the AtmaLingam while he prays for a bit. Ganesh, agrees albeit with a condition
that he will call his name three times, if Ravan does not come back he will place
the AtmaLingam on the ground. Ravan agrees and proceeds to pray. Ganesh as per
the plan just places the AtmaLingam on the ground.

Ravan is devastated and tries to lift the AtmaLingam, but it won't budge. He
uses all his might but fails. Though Ravan's force, breaks a piece of the head of
the Lingam break. This piece falls a few hundered kilometers, that place after
this incident is called Sirathkal (meaning head stone) in the local Tulu language.

In modern times Sirathkal is known as Surathkal, a suburb of
[Mangalore](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mangalore). I spent four years of my
life studying Computer Engineering at
[NITK Surathkal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Technology,_Karnataka).
