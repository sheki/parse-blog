Hello world.

I am Abhishek Kona, also known as Sheki. I currently live in
San Francisco. I work as an engineer at [Parse.com](https://parse.com).

The day of writing this is 23 December, 2014. Coincidentally today is
[Festivus - the Festival for the rest of us](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Festivus).

*Happy Festivus*

I am on a new-year inspired self improvement drive and want to write one blog a
week. I am inspired by [Iron Blogger](http://iron-blogger-sf.com/the-rules/).

Brace yourself.
