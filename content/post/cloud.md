All cloud services have a page where they boast about their top users.
A developer may believe that it is marketing and
it should not be factor in choosing a cloud services.

That line of thinking is a little immature. To understand just chew on this pithy
statement for a while

> The cloud is as scalable as its largest customer.

The truth is nobody builds infinitely scalable data-centers. Software runs on
hardware, which has physical limits, sometimes limits like speed of light.

Usually it is their largest customer which pushes their limits.

For example: Netflix runs on AWS, so you won't likely run into problems running
a video streaming app on AWS, as  Netflix would have already discovered those
problems and AWS would have fixed on them or is fixing right now.

A cloud service is usually pushed to limits by its biggest customer. It is
symbiotic relationship, the big customer discovers flaws and good cloud providers
fix them. So the next time you are deciding a cloud service, look at the biggest
customers of a service, it will give you a measure of the elasticity of
the said cloud.
