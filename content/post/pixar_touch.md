[The Pixar Touch](http://www.amazon.com/The-Pixar-Touch-David-Price/dp/0307278298)
is a well written, easy to read book. It traces the story of Pixar
over 20 years. Some interesting things I learnt:

* Employees who spend 8-12 years in the company did not make much in the IPO. Steve Jobs'
share in the company was 80%. He took back Pixar employees RSU's and gave them new options
forcing them to stay on for 4 more years.  This means some employees worked 12
years but got options worth four years. Steve Jobs was mean.
* George Lucas was a generous investor. He gave people at
Pixar around two years to find a buyer when it was a loss making operation.
* Pixar hired a lot of talent at the top level after  it became famous. I wonder what the
  older employees thought of this.
* Pixar sells the industry standard in animation software called RenderMan.
* The founders were a patient bunch. They were in it for the long run -
  opposite of a serial entrepreneur.
