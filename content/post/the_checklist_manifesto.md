I just finished reading the [Checklist Manifesto](http://www.amazon.com/The-Checklist-Manifesto-Things-Right/dp/0312430000)
by Atul Gawande. From the title I assumed it was a productivity help book. To my
surprise it was actually a book about how checklists help perform critical tasks
efficiently. It has a few good stories from the aviation and medical fields.

This got me thinking - we do not have a checklist in the Software Engineering
business. I have never seen teams check what went wrong in a project.
At times it is even hard to define the start
and end times of a project.

What would a checklist for a software project contain? I think this would
be a **Do-Confirm** checklist according to the book - one you use to
confirm everything is in order before starting.

* Is what is being built clear?
* Are others, people who might review the work, who might use the work, on board with what is being
  built and agree on the idea?
* Who do you communicate with once this is built -> marketing person for an
external product or an internal consumer of the software.
* What are the required features/improvements you need before you can release a version.

Apart from this there is another list you could check, on the first estimated
completion date.

* Is the project complete?
* What took more time then estimated?
* Are some features infeasible?
* Should we change something in the design /  approach?
* Is the software still going to be useful.
* What is the next estimated date?

I want to follow this approach for a few months and see if it makes me a better
Engineer. What do other think about this? Any other kind of checklists you think
will be useful for Software Development?
