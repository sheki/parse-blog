* I spent the Sunday snow boarding at Heavenly resort in South Lake Tahoe. Thanks to the storm on Saturday night, there was fresh powder on all the slopes. It was a great day to snow board.
* In related news it has been a [wet week in the bay area, with 7 inches of rain](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/03/rain-bay-area-el-nino-california-drought/472482/). The fields were lush green on the way up to Tahoe, a welcome relief from the usual California gold color.
* For the first time in my life, I went roller blading. [Church of 8 Wheels](http://www.churchof8wheels.com/) is an event where you roller blade in a church in the Haight. Everyone was having a blast. The crowd was real friendly. I fell a few times. One of the places I should have checked out a long time ago in San Francisco.
