* I spent the Sunday snow boarding at Heavenly resort in South Lake Tahoe. Thanks to the storm on Saturday night, there was fresh powder on all the slopes. It was a great day to snow board.
* In related news it has been a [wet week in the bay area, with 7 inches of rain](http://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/03/rain-bay-area-el-nino-california-drought/472482/). The fields were lush green on the way up to Tahoe, a welcome relief from the usual California gold color.
