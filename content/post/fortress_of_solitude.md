I just finished reading Fortress Of Solitude.

It is growing up story of white kid - Dylan up in a gentrifying
neighborhood of Brooklyn. I picked up this book as I liked Michael Chabon's
**The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay** and felt the books similar in themes.
The author deals with a lot of social issues in a matter of
factly way. This book has references to graffiti, music, comic books.
There is a weird part with a ring with superpowers. I think the book would
have been much better without it.

Overall it is a decent book, not a modern classic, a little long, a little too
American in outlook.
