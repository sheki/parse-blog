Eighteen year me would not have been excited about visiting a small relatively
unknown German university town called [Darmstadt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darmstadt).
Move forward eight years and I have been there 3 times, each time I have had a
better time than before.

Darmstadt is a little university city an hour outside of Frankfurt in the middle
of German suburbia with around hundred thousand people. The geek in me was excited
when I found out that they have a particle accelerator. In fact they discovered a
new element there called Darmstadtium. I think this is their biggest claim to fame.

I went there first to visit my friend Vikas in 2009. It was the annual festival
in Darmstadt - Heinerfest which I have been told by many locals is the second
biggest festival in Germany after Oktoberfest. I take that with a pinch of salt.
But Heinerfest was great,  - I drank a lot of beer,
ate wurst and tried to mingle with girls. I was naive but I had a great time.
So much that I almost moved to Germany for my masters.

The second time, I was taking a two week break in Europe in 2014 and I went to visit Vikas
again. This time he was a married PhD student. He liked Darmstadt so much from
2009 that he decided to live there. I met my friend Vyas who was
in Europe around the same time. We went to town eating and drinking.
We were all a little less broke this time around. I met a few friend from my
2009 trip, most of them with real jobs. We drank,

The third time, I went to visit a new friend, I gave Vikas a break. This time around
I saw the student side of Darmstadt. I slept on a couch in an apartment shared by
four people. All my hosts very generous, they made space for me in their cramped house.
They made me tea, shared their vegan meals, showed me their art, made me smoothies
and took me out dancing to a night club. Sick of me mindlessly strumming the ukelele,
one of them taught me a chord. They were very welcoming and gracious. I made a really good friend,
we had a ball of time - walking, drinking, talking, bantering.

It is pleasantly surprising how I have gone to previously unheard of Darmstadt
thrice. Its no Venice or Paris.  But I guess it does not have to be. You just
need good people and good intentions.
