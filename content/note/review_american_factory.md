American Factory is the story of Fuyao — a Chinese glass company — setting up a factory in Old GM facility in Dayton Ohio. There are a lot of challenges for Fuyaio to overcome:
* The American workers are not as dextrous or hard working as the Chinese.
* The safety laws are stricter in the US
* The workers work a five day week unlike six in China.
* Workers have a right to unionize in the US.

The CEO of Fuyao at some point says that the factory is not here to turn a profit but to prove to America that the Chinese can buy and run a business in China.

The documentary ends by the managers excited about automation that will further cut jobs.

**Questions to ponder:**

* Is it worth competing with China on industries as they have the advantage of cheap labour without much rights.
* How best to handle workers who lose decent paying jobs — their loss of lifestyle is stark.
* It is unrealistic to assume that workers will retrain themselves and get better jobs when they lose jobs — what sort of soft landing mechanisms can society build?
