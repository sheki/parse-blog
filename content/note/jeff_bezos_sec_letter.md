> 	“Jeff, what does Day 2 look like?” That’s a question I just got at our most
> 	recent all-hands meeting. I’ve been reminding people that it’s Day 1 for a
> 	couple of decades. I work in an Amazon building named Day 1, and when I moved
> 	buildings, I took the name with me. I spend time thinking about this topic.
> 	“Day 2 is stasis. Followed by irrelevance. Followed by excruciating, painful
> 	decline. Followed by death. And that is why it is always Day 1.”

> 	Resist Proxies As companies get larger and more complex, there’s a tendency to
> 	manage to proxies. This comes in many shapes and sizes, and it’s dangerous,
> 	subtle, and very Day 2.  A common example is process as proxy. Good process
> 	serves you so you can serve customers. But if you’re not watchful, the process
> 	can become the thing. This can happen very easily in large organizations. The
> 	process becomes the proxy for the result you want. You stop looking at outcomes
> 	and just make sure you’re doing the process right. Gulp. It’s not that rare to
> 	hear a junior leader defend a bad outcome with something like, “Well, we
> 	followed the process.” A more experienced leader will use it as an opportunity
> 	to investigate and improve the process. The process is not the thing. It’s
> 	always worth asking, do we own the process or does the process own us? In a Day
> 	2 company, you might find it’s the second.


> 	Second, most decisions should probably be made with somewhere around 70% of the
> 	information you wish you had. If you wait for 90%, in most cases, you’re
> 	probably being slow. Plus, either way, you need to be good at quickly
> 	recognizing and correcting bad decisions. If you’re good at course correcting,
> 	being wrong may be less costly than you think, whereas being slow is going to
> 	be expensive for sure.  Third, use the phrase “disagree and commit.” This
> 	phrase will save a lot of time. If you have conviction on a particular
> 	direction even though there’s no consensus, it’s helpful to say, “Look, I know
> 	we disagree on this but will you gamble with me on it? Disagree and commit?” By
> 	the time you’re at this point, no one can know the answer for sure, and you’ll
> 	probably get a quick yes.
