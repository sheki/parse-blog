## What the book deals with?

> Research on China, India, and the Middle East has emphasized the inherent
> dynamism of the world’s great civilizations, so today we must ask why economic
> growth took off in Europe rather than Asia or Africa.


## The American policies for economic development:

> Western Europe and the USA made economic development a priority and tried to
> achieve it with a standard set of four policies: creation of a unified
> national market by eliminating internal tariffs and building transportation
> infrastructure; the erection of an external tariff to protect their industries
> from British competition; the chartering of banks to stabilize the currency
> and finance industrial investment; and the establishment of mass education to
> upgrade the labour force. These policies were successful in Western Europe and
> North America, and the countries in these regions joined Britain to form
> today’s club of rich nations. Some Latin American countries adopted these
> policies incompletely and without great success.


## The Big Push strategy for growth

> The countries that have closed the gap with the West in the 20th century have
> done so with a Big Push that has used planning and investment coordination to
> jump ahead.

> The income gaps have expanded with only a few exceptions. The countries that
> were richest in 1820 have grown the most.
                
> Japan was the greatest success of the 20th century, for it was indubitably a
> poor country in 1820 and yet managed to close the income gap with the West.

## The great divergence—or how the west grew at a faster clip

> 1750, most of the world’s manufacturing took place in China (33% of the world
> total) and the Indian subcontinent (25%). Production per person was lower in
> Asia than in the richer countries of Western Europe, but the differentials
> were comparatively small. By 1913, the world had been transformed. The Chinese
> and Indian shares of world manufacturing had dropped to 4% and 1%
> respectively. The UK, the USA, and Europe accounted for three-quarters of the
> total. Manufacturing output per head in the UK was 38 times that in China and
> 58 times that in India. Not only had British output grown enormously, but
> manufacturing had declined absolutely in China and India as their textile and
> metallurgical industries were driven out of business by mechanized producers
> in the West. In the 19th century, Asia was transformed from the world’s
> manufacturing centre into classic underdeveloped countries specialized in the
> production and export of agricultural commodities. 2.


## High wages are big reason for industrialization

> Finally, and most paradoxically, bare-bones subsistence removes the economic
> motivation for a country to develop economically. The need for more output
> from a day’s work is great, but labour is so cheap that businesses have no
> incentive to invent or adopt machinery to raise productivity. Bare-bones
> subsistence is a poverty trap. The Industrial Revolution was the result of
> high wages – and not just their cause.

> Britain’s high-wage, cheap-energy economy made it profitable for British firms
> to invent and use the breakthrough technologies of the Industrial Revolution.



## Protestant work ethic theory is no longer tenable

> Max Weber, for instance, contended that Protestantism made northern Europeans
> more rational and hard-working than anyone else. Weber’s theory looked
> plausible in 1905 when Protestant Britain was richer than Catholic Italy.
> Today, however, the reverse is true, and Weber’s theory is no longer tenable.


## Silver caused Spain to become uncompetitve

> Spain was particularly unlucky. In the 16th century, it looked like the most
> successful imperialist, for Latin America yielded so much silver. Silver
> imports, however, led to much greater inflation in Spain than elsewhere. As a
> result, Spanish agriculture and manufacturing became uncompetitive. The
> constancy in the share of the urban population in Spain masks great changes –
> the populations of old industrial cities collapsed while Madrid expanded on
> the basis of American loot.


## UK had a high tax economy with larger government spending

> In the event, the English state collected about twice as much per person as
> the French state and spent a larger fraction of the national income.

UK was quite authoritarian

> Growth was also promoted by Parliament’s power to take people’s property
> against their wishes. This was not possible in France. Indeed, one could argue
> that France suffered because property was too secure: profitable irrigation
> projects were not undertaken in Provence because France had no counterpart to
> the private acts of the British Parliament that overrode property owners
> opposed to the enclosure of their land or the construction of canals or
> turnpikes across it. What the Glorious Revolution


## Why was the revolution British?

> The crux in explaining why the Industrial Revolution was invented in Britain
> is, therefore, explaining why British inventors spent so much time and money
> doing R&D (Research and Development, that is, Edison’s ‘perspiration’) to
> operationalize what were often banal ideas. The key is that the machines they
> invented increased the use of capital to save labour. Consequently, they were
> profitable to use where labour was expensive and capital was cheap, that is,
> in England. Nowhere else were the machines profitable. That is why the
> Industrial Revolution was British.

Rate of return on capital on industries was higher in Britain.

> In the 1780s, the rate of return to building an Arkwright mill was 40% in
> England, 9% in France, and less than 1% in India. With investors expecting a
> 15% return on fixed capital, it is no surprise that about 150 Arkwright mills
> were erected in Britain in the 1780s, 4 in France, and none in India. Relative
> profitability was similar with the spinning jenny, as was the result – 20,000
> jennies were installed in England on the eve of the French Revolution, 900 in
> France, and none in India. There was no point in spending much time or money
> to invent mechanical spinning in France or India since it was not profitable
> to use it there.

Cheap energy was key.

> The purpose of the Newcomen engine was to drain mines, and Britain had many
> more mines than any other country due to the large coal industry. In addition,
> the early steam engines burned vast quantities of coal, so they were
> cost-effective only where energy was cheap.

Steam was General Purpose technolgy

> Steam power is an example of a general-purpose technology (GPT), that is a
> technology that can be applied to a variety of uses. Other GPTs include
> electricity and computers. It takes decades to develop the potential of GPTs,
> so their contribution to economic growth takes place long after their
> invention. That was certainly true for steam.

> The reason that the Industrial Revolution happened in Europe does not,
> therefore, lie in institutional or cultural differences but rather in the
> continent’s accessible coal reserves and gains from globalization.


## Latin America

> The Pampas could produce beef and wheat at least as well as Pennsylvania, but
> Argentina was too far from Europe for that to be feasible in the colonial
> period. All that Argentina could muster was a small export trade in hides.
> Chile was even more remote.


## USA

America invents replaceable parts

> American government arsenals in Springfield and Harper’s Ferry in the 1820s
> fabricated interchangeable parts for muskets. American firearms exhibited in
> the Crystal Palace Exhibition of 1851 so impressed the British that they sent
> a delegation to study the ‘American system’.


## Africa

> The low population density and high transportation costs limited the
> possibilities for specialized manufacturers supporting large markets.

> African states lacked the legal and cultural institutions that advanced
> agricultural societies used to organize private property such as surveying,
> arithmetic, geometry, and writing.


## Japan invents just in time production

They save on capital requirements by 

> Rather than producing components for inventories that required capital to
> finance, Japanese businesses produced components only as they were needed.
> ‘Just in time’ production is a technique that has proved to be so productive
> that it is now used in settings where capital is cheap as well as where it is
> dear.
