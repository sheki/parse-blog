Notes from a writing class I took at the SF Writers Grotto.

## Advice
In the morning write three pages, let it be free flowing. This piece will usually
not amount to anything but will get you in the habit. Sideline your inner censor.

Submit a lot, keep working on pieces in parallel.

Revise, keep rewriting your piece, a good piece at least goes through 6 revisions.

## Structure of a good piece

### Specificity
A good piece contains a story and not a topic. "Saving a whale" is a topic and
could have a broad scope. "My trip with Greenpeace on a whale saving trip" is a
story.

### Narrative
A good piece contains a change of state, discover something or the narrator goes
through a feeling change.

### Peg
Why do readers care about the story? Is it timely or relevant. Can people connect
to it.
