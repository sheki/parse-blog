* Parking requirements (1 spot per apartment etc) causes folks to construct ugly
parking structures in cities.
* Street parking is cheap. People in SF etc drive around a lot to find free
  street parking, increasing congestion and pollution.
* Poor folks drive less than rich and hence the cheap parking is bigger advantage
  for the rich
