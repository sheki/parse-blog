The book is the story of how Olga recovers when her husband of fifteen years 
abandons her.

The novel had small set of characters and is set in a single apartment.
It is a furious flow of emotion, good book.

Some quotes:

On Turin:
> On first impact, I didn't like they city, it seemed to me metallic; but I soon
discovered how pleasant it was to watch the seasons from the balcony.

On her own, family resonated with my family:
> My own family was full of noisy emotions, always on display, and I—especially
> during adolescence, even when I was sitting mutely, hands covering my ears, in
> a corner of our house in Naples, oppressed by the traffic of Via Salvator Rosa
>—I felt that I was inside a clamorous life and that everything might come apart
> because of a too piercing sentence, an ungentle movement of the body.

On breaking down:
> But I felt that things were taking a turn for the worse, and I was frightened.
> Having to stay alert in order to avoid mistakes and confront dangers had exhausted
> me to the point where sometimes simply the urgency of doing something made me think
> that I really had done it.

This paragraph reminded me of the great Argentinian movie Wild Tales:

> From a small window in the wall to my left a man stuck his head out; he was not disposed to chat, and he got rid of me with a few words and disappeared again: there were no offices, let alone open to the public; everything was reduced to aseptic voice, computer screen, e-mail, bank operation; if a person—he said to me coldly—has anger to vent, sorry, there’s no one here to tangle with.

On recovering:

> To those who hurt me, I react giving back in kind. I am the queen of spades, I am the wasp that stings, I am the dark serpent. I am invulnerable animal who passes through fire and is not burned.
