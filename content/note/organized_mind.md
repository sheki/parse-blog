**Satisficing**  not getting the best option but something good enough. We do this for things that matter less, we pick something good enough. Satisficing is a tool for not

endeavours the old fashioned pursuit of excellence remains the right strategy.


Research says that happy people are not those who have more but people who are happy 
with what they have. (See related note in The Snow Leopard by PM).

**decision making network in our brain does not prioritize**.


A Gibson affordance describes an object whose design features tell you something

Daydreaming and mind wandering, we know are a natural state of the brain. This accounts
for why we feel so refreshed after it and why vacations and naps can be restorative.
Mind wandering mode stands in stark contrast to the state you are in when intensely
focusing on a task. This stay on task mode is responsible for so many things we
do, that researchers have called it the central executive.


Modes of the mind:

* Mind wandering
* Central Executive
* Attentional Filter

People in large urban centres procastinate more due to increased sensory information.


Procastination formula:

```
   Procastination = (Time to complete task  *  distractability  *  delay ) /
                        (Self confidence * task value)

```


It is important to disconnect your self worth from the outcome of the task.



Self confidence appears to have a genetic basis and is a trait that is relatively
stable across life times.


Flow is not always good, it can be disruptive if it becomes an addiction
and is socially disruptive. Flow folks withdraw from others.


Early risers are more productive - studies.
