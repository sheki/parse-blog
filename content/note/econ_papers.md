## A Noble Purpose Alone Won’t Transform Your Company 

** The level and quality of interpersonal collaboration actually has the greatest 
impact on employee engagement. **

> Consider these two companies: The first is a retail chain with hundreds of
> locations globally — innovative, but basically a sales platform. The second
> is a hospital that treats the world’s most devastating cancers. Which do you
> think has a more engaged workforce?  If you chose the latter, in light of its
> quest to save lives, you wouldn’t be alone. Yet, when we spent time with both
> organizations, we discovered that the working environment in the hospital was
> rife with fear, workforce morale was low, and employee turnover was high. At
> the retail chain, on the other hand, there was a palpable spirit of
> camaraderie, employees were energetic and enthusiastic, and customers were
> very pleased with the service. The retailer had the more engaged workforce by
> a long shot.  It’s a common misconception, both in businesses and in
> management articles and books, that a sense of purpose is what matters most
> when it comes to engaging employees.1 Many leaders concerned with attracting
> and retaining top talent believe that nothing motivates people as much as the
> larger good they might be doing or the chance to change the world.
> Accordingly, they extol the higher virtues of their companies’ missions and
> the meaning of the work they offer.  But our work with more than 300
> companies over the past 20 years, particularly our research using
> organizational network analysis (ONA) and our interviews with executives,
> reveals that purpose is only one contributing factor; the level and quality
> of interpersonal collaboration actually has the greatest impact on employee
> engagement.2 In this article, we’ll explore why collaboration has that effect
> and which behaviors you can adopt and practice to nurture it. 


## Capital makes more money

Rich people get richer thanks to the capital they already own.

> Do wealthier households save a larger share of their incomes than poorer ones?
> We use Norwegian administrative panel data on income and wealth to answer this
> empirical question. The relation between saving rates and wealth crucially
> depends on whether saving includes capital gains. Saving rates net of capital
> gains ("net saving rates") are approximately constant across the wealth
> distribution. However, saving rates including capital gains ("gross saving
> rates") increase markedly with wealth. The proximate explanation is that
> wealthier households own assets that experience persistent capital gains which
> they hold onto instead of selling them off to consume ("saving by holding").
> These joint patterns for net and gross saving rates challenge canonical models
> of household wealth accumulation. They are instead consistent with theories in
> which time-varying discount rates or portfolio adjustment frictions keep
> households from realizing capital gains. Between 1995 and 2015 Norway's
> aggregate wealth-to-income ratio rose from approximately 4 to 7. "Saving by
> holding" accounts for up to 80 percent of this increase.
