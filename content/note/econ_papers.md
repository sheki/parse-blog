## A Noble Purpose Alone Won’t Transform Your Company 

** The level and quality of interpersonal collaboration actually has the greatest 
impact on employee engagement. **

> Consider these two companies: The first is a retail chain with hundreds of
> locations globally — innovative, but basically a sales platform. The second
> is a hospital that treats the world’s most devastating cancers. Which do you
> think has a more engaged workforce?  If you chose the latter, in light of its
> quest to save lives, you wouldn’t be alone. Yet, when we spent time with both
> organizations, we discovered that the working environment in the hospital was
> rife with fear, workforce morale was low, and employee turnover was high. At
> the retail chain, on the other hand, there was a palpable spirit of
> camaraderie, employees were energetic and enthusiastic, and customers were
> very pleased with the service. The retailer had the more engaged workforce by
> a long shot.  It’s a common misconception, both in businesses and in
> management articles and books, that a sense of purpose is what matters most
> when it comes to engaging employees.1 Many leaders concerned with attracting
> and retaining top talent believe that nothing motivates people as much as the
> larger good they might be doing or the chance to change the world.
> Accordingly, they extol the higher virtues of their companies’ missions and
> the meaning of the work they offer.  But our work with more than 300
> companies over the past 20 years, particularly our research using
> organizational network analysis (ONA) and our interviews with executives,
> reveals that purpose is only one contributing factor; the level and quality
> of interpersonal collaboration actually has the greatest impact on employee
> engagement.2 In this article, we’ll explore why collaboration has that effect
> and which behaviors you can adopt and practice to nurture it.
