Anatole Broyard, a litrary critic for the NYTimes lived in Greenwich village 
right after the war in the 1940s. This book is a snapshopts of his observations.

> The forties, seemed to have lost the world itself. It was as if these men had
> been blinded by reading. Their heads were so filled with books, fictional
> characters, and symbols that there was no room for the raw data of actuality.
> They couldn’t see the small, only the large.

People were making fun of hipsters even in 1940.

> ... piece I’d written called “Portrait of the Hipster.”

On the importance of reading nature poets from a dying man:

> And remember to read the nature poets—a pastoral a day keeps the doctor away.
> Don’t be so proud of your anxiety.

Why jazz was not considered a full art form:

> Also, it seemed to me that jazz relied too much on improvisation to be a
> full-fledged art form. Nobody could be that good on the spur of the moment.
> And there was too much cuteness in jazz. It stammered and strained. It took
> its sentimentality for wisdom.It seemed to me that jazz was just folk art. It
> might be terrific folk art, but it was still only local and temporary.

Everyone was a pretend writer in the village:

> Half of the young men in the Village were writing such notes. They wrote them
> in cafeś, in the park, even on the street. You’d see them stop and pull out
> their pads or notebooks to jot down something that had just struck them—the
> color of the sky, the bend of a street, an incongruity. These notes were
> postcards to literature that we never mailed.

> Reading had turned him into a saint or angel of scholarship, but in some ways
> I suspected that he was a martyr too, a Saint Sebastian shot through with
> arrows of abstraction.


If you did not get art, you became a critic:

> It was such a relief to me to know that art could be explained. If I couldn’t
> love art for itself, I could love it, like Schapiro, for the explanations. It
> was better than never to have loved at all.
