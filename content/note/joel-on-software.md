* Write a software spec before doing a multi week project.
** Spec should be funny
** start top down.
** The goal of the spec is to make people to read it.
** Its your job to get people to read it.
* Bugs should be fixed before adding new features.
* Do estimate planning in excel.
* If you are rotting in what you are doing - change something.
* Spend time on the UI for a demo. People look at the UI not the algorithm.
* Programmers who check in lot of bugs and then fix them are rewarded - so true.
