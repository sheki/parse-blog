You procrastinate because of the negative feelings attached to the task.
Try journalling why you do not want to do perform the job. Try CBT techniques of distortions on the reason.

Forgive yourself for previous procrastinations. Helps you get rid of the guilt.

Write a **To Donâ€™t** list before setting about a task you have been procrastinating on. 

Use Rooseveltian focus.
