Peter Matthiessen (PM) goes on an expedition to the Dolpo region of Nepal in pursuit
of a Snow Leopard along with George Schaller. The book is about him discovering
or affirming the tenets of his meditation practice and finding the metaphorical
snow leopard - enlightenment.


PM undertakes this journey in 1978 ~ 6 months after the death of his wife.


On seeking enlightenment:


> A true experience of prajna corresponds to "enlightenment" or liberation—not 
> change, but transformation—a profound vision of his identity with universal life, 
> past, present, and future, that keeps man from doing harm to others and sets him free
> from fear of birth-and-death.


On seeing a child he cannot help


> A child dragging bent useless legs is crawling up the hill outside the village. Nose to the 
> stones, goat dung, and muddy trickles, she pulls herself along like a broken cricket.
> We falter ashamed of our strong step, and noticing this, she gazes up, clear-eyed without
> resentment —it seems much worse that she is pretty. In Bengal, GS says stiffly, beggars will 
> break their children's knees to achieve this pitiable effect for business purposes; that is
> is his way of expressing his distress. But the child that lies here at our boots is not a 
> beggars; she is merely a child, staring in curiosity at tall white strangers. I long to
> give her something a—new life?—yet am afraid to tamper with such dignity. And so I 
> smile as best I can , and say "Namaste".


Try to be happy in the moment:

> I am happy in this moment; we shall be up there in cold weather soon enough.

**On dignity**

> Yet their dignity is unassailable, for the service is rendered for its own sake—it is the task,
> not the employer , that is served. As Buddhists, they know that doing matters more than
> the attainment or reward, that to serve in this selfless way is to be free.

**On attachment**

> In Zen thought, even attachment to the Buddha's "golden words" may get in the way of 
> ultimate perception; hence the Zen expression "Kill the Buddha!'.


> Too much speculation is useless.


Eastern culture emphasizes intuition more, do not underestimate the power of
intuition.


**On enlightenment**


> The Tibetian "Book of the Dead" teaches that a man's last thoughts will determine
> the quality of his reincarnation. Therefore, every moment of life is to be lived
> calmly, mindfully, as if it were the last, to insure that the most is made of the 
> precious human state—the only one in which enlightenment is possible.


> I would like to reach the Crystal Monastery, I would like to see a snow leopard
> but if I do not, that is all right, too.


> Waste no energy on regrets or indecision.


> Simplicity is the whole secret of well-being.


> The absurdity of a life that may well end before one understands it does not 
> relieve one of the duty to live through as bravely and as generously as possible.


The happy go lucky are not weak. The happy-go-lucky spirit, that acceptance
which is not fatalism but a deep trust in life, made me ashamed.


The east seeks flow and they get flow by doing the same thing over and over 
again. A state of optimal but samee existence. The west seeks to find the next
improvement to the overall result. This causes permanent discomfort, All the pain
but perhaps better results.


> Perhaps this dread of transince explains why violence is libidinous, why
> lust devours us, why soldiers choose not to forget their days of horror: we cling to such
> extreme moments, in which we seem to die, yet are reborn.


> When I watch blue sheep, I must watch blue sheepp, not be thinking about sex, danger, 
> or the present, for this present—even while I thinking of it—is gone.


**On coming down the mountain**


> The path I followed breathlessly has faded among stones; in spiritual
> ambition, I have negelected my children and done myself harm, and ther is no way
> back. Nor has anything changed; I am still beset by the same old lusts and ego and 
> emotions, the endless nagging details and irritations—that aching gap between
> what I know and what I am.
