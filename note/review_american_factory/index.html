There are a lot of challenges for Fuyaio to overcome:</p><ul><li>The American workers are not as dextrous or hard working as the Chinese.</li><li>The safety laws are stricter in the US</li><li>The workers work a five day week unlike six in China.</li><li>Workers have a right to unionize in the US.</li></ul><p>The CEO of Fuyao at some point says that the factory is not here to turn a profit but to prove to America that the Chinese can buy and run a business in China.</p><p>The documentary ends by the managers excited about automation that will further cut jobs.</p><p><strong>Questions to ponder:</strong></p><ul><li>Is it worth competing with China on industries as they have the advantage of cheap labour without much rights.</li><li>How best to handle workers who lose decent paying jobs—their loss of lifestyle is stark.</li><li>It is unrealistic to assume that workers will retrain themselves and get better jobs when they lose jobs—what sort of soft landing mechanisms can society build?</li></ul></article></main><footer id=footer></footer></body></html>
