And, he adds, “it’s probably harder to organize service workers than factory workers.” Six employees scattered in a CVS do not have the same type of experience as 600 on a factory floor. The nature of work today reduces labor solidarity.
“Workplaces over time in the economy as a whole probably have become more isolated,” he says. “In fact, the image of anybody working today is one person, staring at a computer screen.” Yes, technology does matter, but sometimes in unexpected ways.</p></blockquote><h2 id=do-not-be-stuffy-interact-with-everyone>Do not be stuffy, interact with everyone.</h2><blockquote><p>“… was the best economist in the world, and there was nothing stuffy about him.

Instead, it is technological progress that will power such growth over time.</p></blockquote><h2 id=do-not-go-after-something-because-there-is-data-available-start-with-what-problem-are-you-trying-to-solve>Do not go after something because there is data available, start with what problem are you trying to solve.</h2><blockquote><p>“I think the way people do economics today is too much governed by the availability of data,” he says. “A lot of the articles that I see written in the journals seem to exist not because there is a problem here that needs to be solved, or a puzzle that needs to be explained, but because I have come upon this enormous bunch of data, [and figure] these data have to include the answer to some question.” But, he adds, that’s “natural,” given the sheer amount of data on hand and the pressure to publish.</p></blockquote></article></main><footer id=footer></footer></body></html>
