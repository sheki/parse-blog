own a piece of land in Switzerland was becoming valuable for a lot of people
because it gives access, a refuge, let’s say. And Swiss farmers who wanted to
expand their fields, to have some more cows, suddenly were competing with a
Russian oligarch.
And obviously, this is not traditional economics. Although I will be rather
laissez-faire, I think this is a case where . . . And indeed, the Swiss
government put a red line around certain areas. Foreigners, I think, can still
buy properties in Zurich or in Geneva, but they are not allowed to compete with
Swiss farmers in buying land. I have not studied Airbnb as much, but I think
it’s a case where you have to look at it that way, that you have a
competition here, in cities. Tourism might be important and interesting, but
it’s not a sense of city. The cities are the people. If the people are gone
from a city, it’s not very interesting.</p></blockquote><h2 id=on-people-moving-to-cities>On people moving to cities</h2><blockquote><p>And in a way, there was a grassroots movement against high-income people
coming to the city. I found that very disturbing because, after all,
high-income people create a lot of jobs for all sorts of income at the same
time. In the same way as you should not exclude poor migrants from coming to
the city, I don’t see any rationale for excluding high-income people either.</p></blockquote><h2 id=on-shenzen>On Shenzen</h2><blockquote><p>I was in Shenzhen in ’84, ’85 maybe. And the city at the time—it was
basically not a fishing village, but it was a small town. It had altogether
about 300,000 people. And the mayor of Shenzhen showed a team of the World
Bank—I was part of it—a plan, and they said, “We want to build a city of
five million. Would you finance infrastructure?”
I did a back-of-envelope calculation. I said, “300,000 to 5 million, are you
kidding? Try to do a city of a million and a half, maybe two million will
conserve infrastructure. This is completely out of the question.”
So Shenzhen is now 12 million people.</p></blockquote></article></main><footer id=footer></footer></body></html>
