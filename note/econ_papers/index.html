impact on employee engagement. **</p><blockquote><p>Consider these two companies: The first is a retail chain with hundreds of
locations globally—innovative, but basically a sales platform. The second
is a hospital that treats the world’s most devastating cancers. Which do you
think has a more engaged workforce? If you chose the latter, in light of its
quest to save lives, you wouldn’t be alone. Yet, when we spent time with both
organizations, we discovered that the working environment in the hospital was
rife with fear, workforce morale was low, and employee turnover was high. At
the retail chain, on the other hand, there was a palpable spirit of
camaraderie, employees were energetic and enthusiastic, and customers were
very pleased with the service. The retailer had the more engaged workforce by
a long shot. It’s a common misconception, both in businesses and in
management articles and books, that a sense of purpose is what matters most
when it comes to engaging employees.1 Many leaders concerned with attracting
and retaining top talent believe that nothing motivates people as much as the
larger good they might be doing or the chance to change the world.
Accordingly, they extol the higher virtues of their companies’ missions and
the meaning of the work they offer. But our work with more than 300
companies over the past 20 years, particularly our research using
organizational network analysis (ONA) and our interviews with executives,
reveals that purpose is only one contributing factor; the level and quality
of interpersonal collaboration actually has the greatest impact on employee
engagement.2 In this article, we’ll explore why collaboration has that effect
and which behaviors you can adopt and practice to nurture it.</p></blockquote><h2 id=capital-makes-more-money>Capital makes more money</h2><p>Rich people get richer thanks to the capital they already own.</p><blockquote><p>Do wealthier households save a larger share of their incomes than poorer ones?
We use Norwegian administrative panel data on income and wealth to answer this
empirical question. The relation between saving rates and wealth crucially
depends on whether saving includes capital gains. Saving rates net of capital
gains (&ldquo;net saving rates&rdquo;) are approximately constant across the wealth
distribution. However, saving rates including capital gains (&ldquo;gross saving
rates&rdquo;) increase markedly with wealth. The proximate explanation is that
wealthier households own assets that experience persistent capital gains which
they hold onto instead of selling them off to consume (&ldquo;saving by holding&rdquo;).
These joint patterns for net and gross saving rates challenge canonical models
of household wealth accumulation. They are instead consistent with theories in
which time-varying discount rates or portfolio adjustment frictions keep
households from realizing capital gains. Between 1995 and 2015 Norway&rsquo;s
aggregate wealth-to-income ratio rose from approximately 4 to 7. &ldquo;Saving by
holding&rdquo; accounts for up to 80 percent of this increase.</p></blockquote></article></main><footer id=footer></footer></body></html>
