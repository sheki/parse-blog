It affects our bodies, our moods, our behavior, the structure of our environments. It can change the cost of living and the likelihood of death. It is a kind of a common language itself.</p></blockquote><h2 id=on-ball-lightning>On ball lightning</h2><blockquote><p>No convincing explanation has been found for this apparition, which is usually associated with storms, and appears as a bright, vaguely spherical ball of electromagnetic energy capable of moving through the air, breaking windows and entering buildings, crawling up walls and along floors , and occasionally killing people stone dead.</p></blockquote><h2 id=on-black-dog>On black dog</h2><blockquote><p>The phrase ‘black dog; became a metaphor for another kind of affliction—melancholy or depression.
