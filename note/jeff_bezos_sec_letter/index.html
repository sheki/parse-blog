recent all-hands meeting. I’ve been reminding people that it’s Day 1 for a
couple of decades. I work in an Amazon building named Day 1, and when I moved
buildings, I took the name with me. I spend time thinking about this topic.
“Day 2 is stasis. Followed by irrelevance. Followed by excruciating, painful
decline. Followed by death. And that is why it is always Day 1.”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Resist Proxies As companies get larger and more complex, there’s a tendency to
manage to proxies. This comes in many shapes and sizes, and it’s dangerous,
subtle, and very Day 2. A common example is process as proxy. Good process
serves you so you can serve customers. But if you’re not watchful, the process
can become the thing. This can happen very easily in large organizations. The
process becomes the proxy for the result you want. You stop looking at outcomes
and just make sure you’re doing the process right. Gulp. It’s not that rare to
hear a junior leader defend a bad outcome with something like, “Well, we
followed the process.” A more experienced leader will use it as an opportunity
to investigate and improve the process. The process is not the thing. It’s
always worth asking, do we own the process or does the process own us? In a Day
2 company, you might find it’s the second.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Second, most decisions should probably be made with somewhere around 70% of the
information you wish you had. If you wait for 90%, in most cases, you’re
probably being slow. Plus, either way, you need to be good at quickly
recognizing and correcting bad decisions. If you’re good at course correcting,
being wrong may be less costly than you think, whereas being slow is going to
be expensive for sure. Third, use the phrase “disagree and commit.” This
phrase will save a lot of time. If you have conviction on a particular
direction even though there’s no consensus, it’s helpful to say, “Look, I know
we disagree on this but will you gamble with me on it? Disagree and commit?” By
the time you’re at this point, no one can know the answer for sure, and you’ll
probably get a quick yes.</p></blockquote></article></main><footer id=footer></footer></body></html>
