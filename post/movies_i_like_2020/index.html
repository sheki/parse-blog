city gets gentrified. David Diggs weaves gracefully weaves hiphop into the
story. I enjoy movies set in San Francisco bay area but Most movies set here
are caricatures (internship). This is a movie captures a bit of the zeitgeist.</p><h2 id=women-at-war-icelandic>Women at War (Icelandic)</h2><p>It is the story of an eco warrior who brings down
electric lines to rebel against the system and how she gets help form an anti
establishment sheep farmer. Watch it as an adventure drama with a unique setting
rather than a movie about ecology or saving the planet. Crisp and sharp—not a
single bit of overacting; very not American.</p><h2 id=vast-of-night>Vast of Night</h2><p>It is a Science fiction movie about aliens set in Cayuga, New
Mexico, yes near Roswell, in the 1950s with two high school students as the
leading characters. The movie was very very very stylistically shot. I do not
much about America before the 2010s and Vast of Night I feel gave me a little
glimpse of post war booming USA. My write up here does a poor job of telling how
great the movie is—just go watch it.</p><h2 id=the-trial-of-the-chicago-7>The Trial of the Chicago 7</h2><p>A movie about the famous trial of some protesters
during the Democratic convention in the late 1960s. It was mostly entertaining
and I learnt some history.</p><h2 id=nothing-fancya-documentary-about-diana-kennedy>Nothing Fancy—a documentary about Diana Kennedy</h2><p>I browse, read and buy a lot of cookbooks and in that process learnt that Diana
Kennedy was the mother of Mexican food writing. In the documentary a ninety plus
year old Diana tells her life story. At that age she drives around, cares
immensely about food and runs cooking classes. She is a force of nature. Diana’s
life was full of decisive action—getting out of boring Britain, coming to Latin
America, not having kids, exploring food and understanding the culture. She did
not plan a career around Mexican food but that’s where her interests led her.
She is a template for how to not lead a cookie cutter life.</p></article></main><footer id=footer></footer></body></html>
