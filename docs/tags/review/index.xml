      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/The-Pixar-Touch-David-Price/dp/0307278298&#34;&gt;The Pixar Touch&lt;/a&gt;
is a well written, easy to read book. It traces the story of Pixar
over 20 years. Some interesting things I learnt:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Employees who spend 8-12 years in the company did not make much in the IPO. Steve Jobs&amp;rsquo;
share in the company was 80%. He took back Pixar employees RSU&amp;rsquo;s and gave them new options
forcing them to stay on for 4 more years.  This means some employees worked 12
years but got options worth four years. Steve Jobs was mean.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;George Lucas was a generous investor. He gave people at
Pixar around two years to find a buyer when it was a loss making operation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pixar hired a lot of talent at the top level after  it became famous. I wonder what the
older employees thought of this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pixar sells the industry standard in animation software called RenderMan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The founders were a patient bunch. They were in it for the long run -
opposite of a serial entrepreneur.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I just finished reading Fortress Of Solitude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is growing up story of white kid - Dylan up in a gentrifying
neighborhood of Brooklyn. I picked up this book as I liked Michael Chabon&amp;rsquo;s
&lt;strong&gt;The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp;amp; Clay&lt;/strong&gt; and felt the books similar in themes.
The author deals with a lot of social issues in a matter of
factly way. This book has references to graffiti, music, comic books.
There is a weird part with a ring with superpowers. I think the book would
have been much better without it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall it is a decent book, not a modern classic, a little long, a little too
American in outlook.&lt;/p&gt;
